694884902618165248	Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
694885775431835648	The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
694888332099239936	"And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"

673299830094057472	.@KatyTurNBC, 3rd rate reporter &amp; @SopanDeb @ CBS lied. Finished in normal manner&amp;signed autos for 20min. Dishonest! https://t.co/sCglbQjB3o
673300588654927872	@Maddow, you copied incompetent @KatyTurNBC incorrect story. I'm sure you would like to apologize to me on show. Thank you for the courtesy.
673300749649059842	@Pimpburgh2015: @KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump just tweeted that you are a third rate reporter. That's only because I'm being nice!
673300896151969792	.@KatyTurNBC &amp; @DebSopan should be fired for dishonest reporting. Thank you @GatewayPundit for reporting the truth. #Trump2016
673301477901910020	Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
733593259423862785	"I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""not qualified"" to be president because she has ""very bad judgement"" - Bernie said the same thing!"
733594906447372292	Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
733597831261499392	Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
733600358501625857	Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
733600808491753472	I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:30 A.M. Enjoy!
733604767612710912	Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
733613053036666880	Will be interviewed by @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M.  Enjoy!

733691067829215232	"Thanks @piersmorgan!  ""Trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&amp;massively popular candidate this country has ever seen."""
733691591198703616	Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!
733750845280522242	Thank you! An honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @NRA- prior to @GOPconvention! #Trump2016 #2A  https://t.co/ygLUAl7gzx

733837704312410112	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
733838909805887488	Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
722767517349978112	Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
